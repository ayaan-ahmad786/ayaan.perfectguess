The Perfect Guess
The Perfect Guess is a fun and challenging number guessing game. The goal is to guess the correct number, and the computer will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the correct number.

Levels
To add some excitement, the game is divided into three levels:

Level 1 - Easy
Level 2 - Moderate
Level 3 - Hard
Scoring
The number of attempts you take to guess correctly in each level is recorded as your score for that level.
The total of your scores across all levels is your final score.
If your final score is greater than 30, you lose.
If your final score is exactly 30, you did well.
If your final score is less than 30, you win with first rank.
